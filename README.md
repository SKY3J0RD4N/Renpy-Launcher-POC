# Renpy-Launcher-POC
# A proof of concept for launching exes on Renpy engine.
# While this is a python-based program, the ability to other exes with privilage escalation is unknown for the time being.

# To make changes on the progam to use your own exe, go to script.rpy which is available in the zip file and change the target exe in the brackets
# i.e.: subprocess.Popen("C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe")
